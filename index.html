<p>Fergusson "Fergus" Wright Hume (8 July 1859 – 12 July 1932) was a New-Zealand born novelist, playwright, and song writer 
who authored more than 140 novels during his lifetime. His most famous work was <em>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</em> (1886), 
a novel which did a lot to popularize the mystery genre. This repository is an attempt to gather bibliographic information 
about Hume's various works in one place and begin compiling a corpus of his public domain works.I hope that it will be collaborative.</p> 

<h2>This Website</h2>
<p>In the navigation menu on the lefthand side of the page, you'll find links to a sortable bibliography, nineteenth-century reviews of Hume's work,
  and twenty-first century reference works about Hume and his writing.</p>

<h2>The Github Repository</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/HumeBib/HumeBib.github.io/tree/master/python-scripts">python-scripts folder</a>, you'll find scripts to automatically download plain text files of the novels, collections, and short stories of Hume's which have been made freely available online via Project Gutenberg, Hathitrust, and/or the Internet Archive. 
NB: I am new to Python, so this may not be the most elegant way to accomplish the task––feel free to suggest changes or refine as necessary.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/HumeBib/HumeBib.github.io/tree/master/text-files">text-files folder</a>, you'll find all of the plain text f
  iles downloaded using that python script. (These have not been cleaned up at all at this point).</p>

<p>You'll also find [a running bibliography in .csv format](/HumeBib.csv) which lists what I *believe* to be the first editions of Hume's book-form works (based on several initial searches of WorldCat, the Internet Archive, and Hathitrusts). 
  Eventually, I hope to build this out for U.S. / North American editions and World editions (largely, for earlier works, India). I'm also hoping to pinpoint songs, periodical publications, plays, and extant papers (correspondence, etc.). </p>

<strong> Published in <em>The Athenaeum</em> (7 Sept. 1912)</strong>

Mr. Hume's latest book will be welcomed by those who love mysteries. A murder, birth and marriage certificates, and thousands 
of pounds are juggled with in a manner dear to the average novel-reader. There is a villain of the deepest dye who is bearded 
by all the virtuous characters in a way reminiscent of a Drury Lane melodrama. He is finally burnt to death in an East-End 
fire. Needless to say, all ends happily for the righteous people concerned.

The sinister reputation of 'the Blue Talisman' is amply justified as the story proceeds, and the murder of its possessor is
but the prelude to a series of sensational events. The author has apparently aimed at providing excitement at the expense 
of verisimilitude, and his characters are those of conventional melodrama.

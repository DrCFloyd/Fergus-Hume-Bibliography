<strong>Published in <em>The Athenaeum</em> (10 May 1913)</strong>

In this story a wealthy youth is murdered by a jealous woman, and suspicion falls on his sister, who inherits his money. 
A deformed street-musician who can see in the dark is the only figure with a touch of originality. The book is carelessly 
written, and the construction of the plot, the characters, and particularly the style suffer in consequence.

title: Review of <em>The Mystery Queen</em>

<strong>Published in <em>The Athenaeum</em> (24 Aug. 1912)</strong>

As the title suggests, this is a mystery novel, but as such it will prove a disappointment to the reader. The transparency of 
the plot leaves too little to the imagination; the characters are weakly drawn, and the story is full of faultless heroes and 
stereotyped villains.

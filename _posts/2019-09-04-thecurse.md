<strong>Published in <em>The Athenaeum</em> (29 Nov. 1913)</strong>

A modern story of mystification and horror and black magic. Readers who find it amusing to follow heroes and heroines and 
villains, all labelled in capital letters, rushing along torturous paths leading either to joy or destruction, will like the 
book immensely; those who prefer more sober pleasures will probably get no fuether than a few pages.

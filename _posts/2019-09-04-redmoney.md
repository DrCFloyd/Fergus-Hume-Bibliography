A gipsy who is also a baronet and a millionaire is somewhat of a surprise even in fiction, but it is a position which gives an
opportunity for an interesting 'double life.' There is a good deal of gipsy jargon and passion and revenge, but out of a 
network of intrigue the hero and heroine emerge triumphant over the dead bodies of their enemies, who are delivered up to a 
veritable pogrom.

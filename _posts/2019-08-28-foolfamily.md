Yet one more theatrical novelty has died practically still-born. 'The Fool of the Family,' by Mr. Fergus Hume, produced 
on Thursday in last week at the Duke of York's Theatre, languished until Saturday, when it expired. It was a species of 
melodramatic rendering of 'L'Aventuriere' of M. Augier––was clumsy in construction and poor in dialogue. Mr. Cartwright 
essayed in it, with no special success, a light comedy part. One or two parts were tolerably played. No opposition was 
encountered. The piece simply died because, as the French say, it was not viable.

title: Review of <em>A Son of Perdition: An Occult Romance</em>

<strong>Published in <em>The Athenaeum</em> (20 Apr. 1912)</strong>

The occult plays a large part in this somewhat sensational story. The hero and heroine, however, come through their adventures 
unscathed, and set up house for the benefit of humanity in general. The author's style lacks literary merit.

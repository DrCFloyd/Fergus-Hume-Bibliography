<strong>Published in <em>The Athenaeum</em> (18 Oct. 1913)</strong>

The villain of the story is a 'nut' with a cherubic face, by whose machinations the hero is involved in a murder mystery which 
includes an unexpected fortune. The inevitable love-interest enters into the tale; blackmail helps the action along; and an 
orange-spotted dress appears at critical moments. The writing is careless and hasty.
